# Template script

Template script is a small, experimental language for generating code written in C. It main features are:
* It uses lazy evaluation avoiding the generation of large intermediate strings
* It has a console based debugger allowing you to break on line and column of the generated files
* It allows for adding new fields, methods and functions for your data type

This is still work in progress.
